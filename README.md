Pokedex app

This is a web app made using HTML, CAA and Javascript as part of my curriculum with the CareerFoundry Full Stack Web Development program. The list pulls from a Pokemon API to display images and information is a Bootstrap modal when each Pokemon is clicked.

The following were used to create this app:

HTML
CSS 3.0
JavaScript
JQuery 3.3.1
Bootstrap 4.3.1

Fetch
Promise
